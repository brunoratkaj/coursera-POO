POO part 1:

Week 1 and 2: 2048 - implementing grid-based numbers game. Ephasis on programming the merge of the tile values in a row or column.

Week 3: Tic Tac Toe (Monte Carlo method) - implementing Tic Tac Toe game using Monte Carlo simulation for machine player moves.

Week 4: Yahtzee - lost the program, I'll do it again soon.

Week 5: Cookie Clicker - game built around a simulation in which your goal is to bake as many cookies as fast as possible. Emphasis on                              counting, sums and high-order functions.

POO part 2:

Week 1: Zombie apocalypse - implementing simulation of zombies and humans interacting on a grid. Emphasis on generators, stacks, queues                               and grid.

Week 2: Word Wrangler - implementing a word game. Emphasis on recursions and sorting.

Week 3: Tic Tac Toe (MINMAX strategy) - implementing Tic-Tac-Toe that uses a Minimax strategy for machine player moves.

For most of the projects a program template was recieved. The main goal was to implement functionality of the task.
